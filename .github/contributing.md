## Bugs

Please provide as much context as possible, and if you want to start working on a fix, we'll be forever grateful! Please try and test around for a bit to make sure you're dealing with a bug and not an issue in your implementation.

If possible, provide a demo where the bug is isolated and turned into its smallest possible representation. That would help a lot!

## Feauture Requests

Feel free to request any feature that interests you, no matter how big or small. Note that we might not implement the feature you want, or exactly how you want it.
